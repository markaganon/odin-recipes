        <p>
            Filipino adobo is a classic and beloved dish that holds a special place in Filipino cuisine. 
            Considered the national dish of the Philippines, adobo showcases the rich and diverse flavors of the country. 
            It is a culinary masterpiece that has been passed down through generations and remains a staple in Filipino households and restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adobo typically consists of marinated meat, commonly pork or chicken, but variations can include beef, seafood, or even vegetables. 
            The meat is first marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices such as black peppercorns, bay leaves, and sometimes sugar. 
            The marinating process allows the flavors to infuse deeply into the meat, resulting in a tantalizing and complex taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beauty of adobo lies in its versatility. 
            Each region, family, or cook may have their own unique twist on the recipe. 
            Some may add additional ingredients like potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, or pineapple to enhance the flavors and textures. 
            The method of cooking can also vary, with some preferring to braise the meat until it is melt-in-your-mouth tender, while others opt for a more caramelized and crispy finish.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result is a dish that is simultaneously comforting and vibrant, with a distinct balance of flavors that excite the palate. 
            Adobo is often enjoyed with steamed rice, allowing the grains to soak up the delectable sauce and complement the meat.

            <li>6 Garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2/3 Cup cane vinegar or unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup soy sauce</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
            Peel and core pineapple. Cut half of pineapple into bite-size pieces (about 1"); set aside. 
            Chop remaining pineapple into small pieces and transfer to a small saucepan. 
            Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very soft and broken down and nearly all juice is evaporated, 15–18 minutes. 
            Transfer to a blender and add ¼ cup water; purée until smooth.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. 
            Lightly season pork with salt and pepper. 
            Working in 2 batches, cook pork until well browned on all sides, 5–8 minutes per batch. 
            Transfer to a plate.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Reduce heat to medium-low and add onion and garlic to same pot. 
            Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and softened, about 5 minutes. 
            Return pork to pot and stir in pineapple purée. 
            Add vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, peppercorns, bay leaves, and ¾ cup water and stir to combine. 
            Bring to a simmer and cover pot. 
            Reduce heat so adobo is at a very gentle simmer and cook until pork is tender, 45–50 minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. 
            Cook reserved bite-size pineapple pieces, tossing occasionally, until golden brown all over, 5–8 minutes. 
            Transfer to a plate.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Uncover pot and skim off any fat from surface. 
            Increase heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until sauce is thick and shiny, about 15 minutes. 
            Gently stir in caramelized pineapple. 
            Remove and discard bay leaves.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
            Serve pork adobo over rice, topped with scallions.
